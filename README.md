- Download and install **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)**

Anaconda is a free package manager, environment manager, and Python distribution that contains a collection of 1,000+ open source packages. An installation of Anaconda comes preinstalled with many of the Python packages we'll be using such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn and is the recommended way to install Jupyter Notebooks.
