## Technical Requirements

- Download and install **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)**

Anaconda is a free package manager, environment manager, and Python distribution that contains a collection of 1,000+ open source packages. An installation of Anaconda comes preinstalled with many of the Python packages we'll be using such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn and is the recommended way to install Jupyter Notebooks.


## Datasets

This tutorial uses three datasets. Two of the three datasets can be found in the "datasets" folder. The third dataset can be downloaded from the following Kaggle link:

**[Gun Violence In America](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data)**

Once downloaded, rename the file to "gun_violence.csv" and place it in the "datasets" folder.
